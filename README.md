# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Jaydon Antoine**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon API Get A Pokemon** is an android app that **the displays a random pokemon pulled from the PokeAPI. At the moment, it displays an image of the back of the character, its name, alongside its weight.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêâüê≥ü¶Ñ**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokeAPI**.

## Notes

Once again, this project proved to be a very valuable learning experience. In this case, it proved to be difficult to find an API that was easy to use within the AsyncHTTPClient framework provided. 
As a result, I ended up scratching my plans to build a music app, and stuck with one of the recommended APIs, in this case the PokeAPI. 

The main struggle I encountered was being able to parse through the JSON data, specifically for desplaying the image/sprite associated with the randomly chosen pokemon. For some reason, 
the JSON response was formatted in a way that made it very difficult to single out a specific image URL. After a few hours of trying, I ended up settling with just removing leading and trailing 
elements from the pokeImage string so that I would end up with the very first URL of the "sprites" JSON. Moving foward, I will look into better ways to get this feature to work, as I would love 
to have the front facing sprite be displayed instead.
